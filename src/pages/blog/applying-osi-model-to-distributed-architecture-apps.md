*The OSI model has been used to describe and categorize computer networking devices, protocols, and software for decades. What lessons can it offer us about how we should design our software systems and architectures?*

## The OSI Model

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model):

> The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols.

## Communication using the OSI Model

## Encapsulation in the OSI Model

## Encapsulation and Layered Design

Design should be applied in layers of abstraction. Apps often benefit from being built in vertical slices, but each slice should pass through discrete logical (and sometimes physical) layers of abstraction and encapsulation.

## Example without logical separation

## Example with logical separation

## Summary
